# Stack overflow in "My First Songs"

By manipulating the notes files in "My First Songs" we can cause a stack overlow. This leads to easy rop-chain execution. Only downside: The rop-chain is parsed as a string, so we can't use '\0' inside the chain.

# Usage

This has been tested with My First Songs (EUR, 00050000-1016A300)

- Generate a `Farmer_ENG.csv` via `python ./generate.py`
- Copy the file to `/content/Resources/Note/Farmer_ENG.csv`
- Start the game, choose `Karaoke`, then select play `THE FARMER IN THE DELL` as 1 Player
- wait :)
