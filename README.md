# Wii U /vol/content Exploits

This repository contains serveral exploits for the Wii U which are based on manipulating files in `/vol/content`. 

# Manipulating files in /vol/content (also known as contenthax)

On the Wii U it's possible to modify any files in the `content` directory without breaking any signature checks. The most prominent example of this is probably [haxchi](https://github.com/FIX94/haxchi), but other titles are exploitable as well.

This repository contains exploits for the following games:

- [My First Songs](https://github.com/Maschell/WiiUVolContentExploits/MyFirstSong) (EUR, 00050000-1016A300)

These exploits don't really have any real-world usage because of missing JIT-access in these titles. In 2023 we have much better exploits anyway. This is just for fun.
