# Stack overflow in "Spot The Differences: Party!"

By manipulating the texture information in "Spot The Differences: Party!" we can cause a stack overlow. This leads to easy rop-chain execution. Only downside: The rop-chain is parsed as a string, so we can't use '\0' inside the chain.

# Usage

This has been tested with Spot The Differences: Party! (EUR, 00050000-10149200)

- Generate a `01.001.01.txt` via `python ./generate.py`
- Delete all files in `/content/texture` (The game select a random map, if we only have one map we always trigger the exploit!)
- Copy the file to `/content/texture/01.001.01.txt`
- Start the game, select "PLAY SOLO"
- wait :)
