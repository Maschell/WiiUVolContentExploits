# Stack overflow in "Blasting Agent: Ultimate Edition"

By manipulating the level data "Blasting Agent: Ultimate Edition" we can cause a stack overlow. This leads to easy rop-chain execution. Only downside: The rop-chain is parsed as a string, so we can't use '\0' inside the chain. This is probably the most boring bug ever.

# Usage
